Certainly, here are the `pip install` commands for the required libraries used in the image matching program:

1. **Install TensorFlow** (for deep learning and image processing):
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

2. **Install Pillow** (for image loading and processing):
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. **Install imagehash** (for perceptual hashing):
   ```bash
   pip install imagehash
   ```

4. **Install scikit-learn** (for image similarity calculations):
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

You can run each of these commands in your terminal or command prompt to install the required libraries for the image matching program. Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed in your environment.
