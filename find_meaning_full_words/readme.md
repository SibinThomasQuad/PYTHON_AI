To create a Python program that identifies meaningful words in a string, you can use natural language processing libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to perform part-of-speech tagging. This approach can help you extract nouns, adjectives, or other parts of speech that represent meaningful words. Here's a basic example using NLTK:

First, you need to install the NLTK library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Now, you can create a Python program:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import words

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('words')

# Initialize NLTK and download the words corpus
nltk.download('words')

# Define an input string
input_string = "This is a sample sentence with meaningful words."

# Tokenize the input string into words
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(input_string)

# Get a list of English words from the NLTK corpus
english_words = set(words.words())

# Filter the tokens to keep only meaningful words
meaningful_words = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() in english_words]

# Display the meaningful words
print("Meaningful words found in the input string:")
print(meaningful_words)
```

In this example:

1. We use NLTK to tokenize the input string into words.

2. We download the NLTK `words` corpus, which contains a list of English words.

3. We filter the tokens from the input string to keep only those that exist in the set of English words from the corpus.

4. Finally, we print the meaningful words found in the input string.

This approach focuses on identifying English words from the input string, but it doesn't perform advanced natural language understanding. For more sophisticated word extraction and context analysis, you may consider using more advanced NLP techniques and libraries like spaCy or the Natural Language Toolkit for Python (spaCy, also known as "spacy").
