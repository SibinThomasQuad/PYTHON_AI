To install the required libraries for the simple Python program to identify an image, you can use `pip` to install the necessary packages. You need to install `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `keras`, and `Pillow`. Here's the `pip` command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy keras Pillow
```

Running this command in your terminal or command prompt will install the required packages for the image identification program. Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed and configured in your environment before running this command.
